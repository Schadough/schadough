## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“

### My name is Michael but people on the Internet call me _Schadough_.   
(yes, you guessed it, _Schadough_ is actually pronounced like _**Shadow**_ :o)  
  
  I'm a Software Developer who focuses primarily on Web and Mobile Applications in React and React Native in Typescript.
